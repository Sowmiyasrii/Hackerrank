PROBLEM:
WELCOME TO JAVA!

Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.

The code stubs in your editor declare a Solution class and a main method. Complete the main method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of your main method.

System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");

Input Format
There is no input for this challenge.

Output Format
You must print two lines of output:

Print Hello, World. on the first line.
Print Hello, Java. on the second line.

Sample Output
Hello, World.
Hello, Java.



SOLUTION:

public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("Hello, World.");
     System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
        
    }
}


PROBLEM:
JAVA STDIN AND STDOUT-1
Task
In this challenge, you must read  integers from stdin and then print them to stdout. Each integer must be printed on a new line. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor below.

Input Format

There are  lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.

Sample Input

42
100
125
Sample Output

42
100
125


SOLUTION:


import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int c= scanner.nextInt();
        int d = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
    }
}
